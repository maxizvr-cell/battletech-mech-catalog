To save weight on the 'Mech and still allow for high speeds, the Beowulf is powered by a 270 XL engine that weighs half as much as a standard fusion engine. It also mounts MASC, enhancing its top speed of 129.6 km/h to allow it to keep up with most light 'Mechs. To traverse rough terrain, the Beowulf has six jump jets that allow it to jump up to 180 meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Beowulf carries eight and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Extended Torso Twist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.03</color></b>",

Finally, the 'Mech has four Intek Medium Lasers for close range defense, one in each arm firing forward and two in its torso covering the rear. With only two tons of ammo for the LB-X 10 and one ton for the Ultra, if it runs dry the Cataphract must fall back to be reloaded before continuing the fight. Eleven tons of armor combined with CASE allowed the Cataphract to easily absorb damage. Sixteen heat sinks keep it cool while four HildCo Model 12 jump jets gave it a jumping distance of one hundred and twenty meters.

The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery snapped up a number of the original CPR-HD-002 models. While not increasing the original model's meager four and half tons of armor coverage, Solaris Arms chose to replace the original Durallex plating with ArcShield Reflective Armor to enhance its endurance against the large volume of energy weapons carried by Arena 'Mechs. Already a relatively speedy design, the addition of a Supercharger enhanced its ground speed. Its extremely short jumping distance was neither improved nor removed; instead it was retained to expand a pilot's options in tight terrain. An extra Double Heat Sink, bringing the total to thirteen, is still not enough to keep up with the increased heat produced by the CPR-HD-003's advanced laser weaponry.

The main gun of the Corvis is its UAC/10, backed up by a pair of medium pulse lasers. These guns enable the Corvis to operate effectively in medium to short ranges. Between the generous supply of autocannon ammunition and 10 double heat sinks that keep the 'Mech chilled, the Corvis can operate without resupply for a respectable amount of time.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Modular Weapons</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.08</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Right Lower</color>",

The final design that was accepted became the current incarnation of the Cossack. The Cossack is built on a Taijian Series X Endo Steel chassis to save weight. More weight was cut from the design by using a lightweight Hermes 120 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 97.2 km/h. Six Pitban LFT-65 jump jets allow the Cossack to jump up to hundred and eighty meters, allowing the 'Mech to easily handle most rough terrain. For protection, the Cossack has three tons of armor and has ten heat sinks to handle the heat produced by the weapons payload carried by the 'Mech. Overall, the compromise that created the Cossack has turned it into a light trooper 'Mech that works well as part of a team but alone excels at no one role.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Extended Torso Twist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.97</color></b>",

In addition, the center torso Large Laser, the AMS and the advanced targeting-tracking system were also removed and the double heat sinks replaced with standard single versions. The design now instead only carries two arm-mounted Large Lasers and five Medium Lasers.

The primary weapons on the Flashman FLS-8K are three Large Lasers mounted in the right arm, left arm, and center torso. These are backed up by five Medium Lasers, two mounted in either arm coaxial to the large lasers, two in the left torso and one in the right. The Flashman also carries an Anti-Missile System with one ton of ammo in the right torso to defend against missile attacks, and a Flamer in the head, to deter infantry attacks. The use of a Faust/Shinji AT/TS targeting-tracking system gives the Flashman a level of accuracy few can match, while fifteen double heat sinks give it an effective heat management system. The 'Mech is also notable for using an extralight engine which makes it fast for its size, though not at the expense of protection thanks to thirteen and a half tons of armor.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Rugged</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.09</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

Though it outgunned the earlier design and found significant acceptance within the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Galahad suffered from the same heat issues as the BattleMech it was meant to replace. With the development of the new Gauss Rifle, Mitchell Vehicles decided in 2594 to redesign the Galahad around these new weapons. The Galahad utilizes special building materials in the form of eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and Endo Steel internals. To fit the massive weapons on the Galahad, the engine was dropped to a GM 180, giving it a maximum speed of only 54 km/h, making it difficult for the 'Mech to keep up with its companions in most cases. The GLH-2D carries two massive M-7 Gauss Rifles, with two tons of ammo for each rifle.

Following the Battle of Nox in 2475, the dishonored 'Mech was retired from official production, with NSAW closing down the production lines by 2488. Merryweather Industries was the first private company to attempt BattleMech production without governmental support. Despite their location in the Terran Hegemony, they acquired the plans to the Gladiator and produced a new run in 2490. They were unable to raise the capital to finish their second run, the 4R, and nearly went bankrupt before moving into IndustrialMechs. The GLD-4R production lines were closed down in 2495. A few salvaged Gladiator -1Rs were still in service with militaries across the Inner Sphere and Periphery, though these relics were finally pushed to extinction during the Reunification War. The 55-ton Gladiator has a top speed of 86 km/h, comparable to many other 'Mechs of the same weight. Nine and a half tons of armor provides a respectable amount of protection.

Initially designed as a dedicated city and installation defender, the original model featured a variety of weaponry along with fifteen and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, but perhaps its most useful asset were the three Hildco jump jets giving it a jumping range of 90 meters. The heaviest 'Mech design to feature jump jets at the time, their original task was to allow the Highlander the ability to jump over inconvenient obstacles such as buildings and outpace other 'Mechs with a faster ground speed, but because of this increased mobility and its versatile weaponry the Highlander proved to be a capable fighter on any battlefield and within decades nearly every BattleMech regiment of the Regular and Royal Armies featured them. However it was during the design's initial trial runs that pilots began using these 'Mechs in what would infamously become known as the \"Highlander Burial\". Leaping into the air and landing directly on their enemy, a Highlander could literally drive a light 'Mech into the ground. So successful was this maneuver that the design team re-engineered the legs to withstand repeated death-from-above attacks and turned what had been a desperation move into an art form, giving Highlander pilots an additional psychological edge.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Reinforced Legs</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.14</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Right Lower</color>",

Keeping the LRM rack of the 4B, the Double B upgrades the Holly LRM-15 launcher with an Artemis IV system, swaps the PPC for an Kinslaughter H-Class ER PPC, and increases the 'Mech's survivability with a Guardian ECM system, CASE in both torsos, double heat sinks, and an anti-missile system. However, the design's speed and armor were not upgraded, enforcing the need to deploy the 4Bb as a fire-support unit.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Rugged</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Upper, Right Upper</color>",

The designers made the decision to slow the 'Mech's top speed even further as the preferred option. With the additional weight, both ammo magazines were upgraded with CASE and the designers installed an additional 3 Medium Lasers with the heat sinks upgraded to double strength models to handle the increased heat. The 5 completed prototypes served with distinction on Tukayyid, though the design never reached production status; with only 2 other conversions finished before the Word of Blake seized Terra and the remaining stocks of 9Hb’s.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Maintain</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.18</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Upper, Right Upper</color>",

An ER Large Laser serves as the sole weapons system, augmented by a new fire control system and the C3 unit. A cheap upgrade, this is a favorite of pilots who were previously assigned a 68; with many praising the enhanced range and accuracy of the Laser. Paired into demi lances, and assigned a C3 Master equipped mech to coordinate, these Mongoose's are deployed as head hunters and long range harassers; both roles that make use of their high ground speed and manoeuvrability. Fast and deadly, they have already made a name for themselves, with one Mongoose formation accounting for 5 kills, including a Star Colonel in a Timberwolf during the Great Refusal. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Pilot</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.98</color></b>",

The Nexus has a top speed of 119 km/h and is powered by a 175-rated fusion engine which is both light and rugged. To save weight without the vulnerability of an XL engine, the Nexus is built on a Endo Steel chassis. For protection, the 'Mech carries a light two tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, relying on its speed and maneuverability, which is enhanced with a jumping capability of up to one hundred and twenty meters.

This variant switches the Gauss Rifle to an Ultra Autocannon/10 and downgrading the LRM-20 rack into an LRM-15.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Anti-Air Targeting</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.15</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

The more refined X2 variant faced considerable scrutiny by SLDF evaluators in 2684, successfully meeting the SLDF's requirements but still rejected thanks to its high fuel consumption and the bad press generated by the earlier X1. Twenty SHD-X2 were built for trials with potential customers, but failed to attract any interest.

Both companies swiftly opened their own lines, producing multiple variants of the Talos for their own use and for export further afield.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Pilot</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.04</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Right Lower</color>",
